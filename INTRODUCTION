---HBASE(Hadoop Database)---------------------
Hbase is one of the NOSQL database as far as hadoop is concerned.Hbase is meant for real time random reads/random write in against to the 
sequential file accessing of HDFS.

Hbase  is open-source ,distributed, fault-tolerant ,scalable non-relational, multi-dimensiional,versioned & colukmn oriented DB built 
on top of the GOOGLE's FILESYSTEM(GFS).

The Data is Hbase will be organized by the means of table only (as part of the x-axis,y-axis & z-axis).

Data will be stored in the form of (K,V) pair where K-> Timestamp generated by Hbase, V-> Data what we load

---Component of HBase-----------------------------------

Hmaster (Hmaster), Zookeeper(HQuorum, Quorum, QuorumPeerMain), Region Server(HRegion Server) , Regions 

Hmaster: Metadata Storage of all Hbase table data
         For bootstrap each & every region server 
         To provide failover mechanism of region server 
         Region v/s Region server mapping
         To start hbase daemon : start-hbase.sh
         
         Hmaster configuration : we will configure the Hmaster in $Hbase_home/conf/hbase-site.xml
                                <property>
                                <name> hbase.rootdir</name>
                                <value>hdfs//localhost:8020/hbase</value>
                                </property>
                          
                                In the above property, hbase will define the HDFS path where the hbase tabular data will be stored.
                                
                                <property>
                                <name> hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
                                <value>true</value>
                                </property>
                          
                                In the above property value is true, which means that hmaster & zookeeper are running in a distributed model.
