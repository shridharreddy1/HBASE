 HBase run on top of hadoop.
 It is an database which is open source, non-relational, distributed, NOSQL database modelled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java.
 Hadoop can only perorm batch processing and data will be accessed in a sequential manner leading to low latency.
 HBase internally uses hash tables and provides random access and stores the data in HDFS files that are indexed(sorted) by thier key for 
 faster look ups that provide high latency compared to HDFS.
 
> But Hadoop was mainly introduced for batch processing but companies also needed a database which could be used for real-time responses.
  So ,Google came up with the Bigtable, A column-oriented data base to address the real-time queries.

Hadoop >> Storage    >> HDFS >> lack of indexing, sequential access, high latency  
       >> Processing >> MR
NOSQL  >> Storage    >> In the form of (K,V) pair
       >> Processing >> Mongodb,couchdb,cassandra, Hbase, Google bigtable's >> Perform basic CRUD operation
       >> Demerit    >> No support for Join , No specific query language

> Before going deep into Apache HBase and its operations, letâ€™s first understand Column-oriented database.

Column-oriented databases differ from row oriented traditional databases where entire rows are stored contiguously.
In Column-oriented database data are grouped by columns and subsequent columns are stored contiguously on the disk.
Storing values on a per column basis increases the efficiency when all the values are not needed.

The Data is Hbase will be organized by the means of table only (as part of the x-axis,y-axis & z-axis).
Data will be stored in the form of (K,V) pair where       K-> Timestamp generated by Hbase,     V-> Data what we load

>>>>         To start hbase daemon            : start-hbase.sh
             To Enter into Hbase shell        : Hbase shell

Hmaster: Metadata Storage of all Hbase table data
         For bootstrap each & every region server 
         To provide failover mechanism of region server 
         Region v/s Region server mapping
       
Hmaster configuration : we will configure the Hmaster in $Hbase_home/conf/hbase-site.xml
                        <property>
                        <name> hbase.rootdir</name>
                        <value>hdfs//localhost:8020/hbase</value>
                        </property>
                          
                        In the above property, hbase will define the HDFS path where the hbase tabular data will be stored.
                                
                        <property>
                        <name> hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
                        <value>true</value>
                        </property>
                          
                        In the above property value is true, which means that hmaster & zookeeper are running in a distributed model.
