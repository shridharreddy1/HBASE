The process of keeping track of multiple changes happening to a particular tablecell is versioning.
hbase0.98.x & above version are having the default version as 1.

---How to update data in hbase 

by using the same 'put' command we can update the very hbase table but hbase internally manages the versioning concept 
therefore we can see the previous version of update command.
put '<tablename>','<rowno.>','<colfam>','<..........>'


---Delete a column in hbase

alter 'htab',{NAME=>'colfam2',METHOD=>'delete'}

---Alter command in hbase
In the below structural changes of hbase tables only we are making use of alter command
      1. Changing the number of version of a column family 
      2. Adding/Removing  a column family
      
--Versioning  
      By default versioning is 1 but updating it to 5
      alter 'htab' ,{NAME => "colfam1",VERSIONS=>5}
    
      by using 'put' command change the column values
      
      For getting the version values
      scan 'htab',VERSIONS=>5 
      no limit for version but will display the top 5 version
      
      
      
  NOTE : Hbase will only understand one datatype i.e BYTEARRAY
         
         There is no query support as far as hbase is concerned however to access the data from hbase table 
         there is seprate component called apache Phoenix which is a SQL skin on top of Hbase
         
         we will not get 'natural join' support from hbase.
