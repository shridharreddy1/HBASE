 HBase run on top of hadoop.
 It is an database which is open source, non-relational, distributed, NOSQL database modelled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java.
 Hadoop can only perorm batch processing and data will be accessed in a sequential manner leading to low latency.
 HBase internally uses hash tables and provides random access and stores the data in HDFS files that are indexed(sorted) by thier key for 
 faster look ups that provide high latency compared to HDFS.
 
> But Hadoop was mainly introduced for batch processing but companies also needed a database which could be used for real-time responses.
  So ,Google came up with the Bigtable, A column-oriented data base to address the real-time queries.

Hadoop >> Storage    >> HDFS >> lack of indexing, sequential access, high latency  
       >> Processing >> MR
NOSQL  >> Storage    >> In the form of (K,V) pair
       >> Processing >> Mongodb,couchdb,cassandra, Hbase, Google bigtable's >> Perform basic CRUD operation
       >> Demerit    >> No support for Join , No specific query language

> Before going deep into Apache HBase and its operations, letâ€™s first understand Column-oriented database.

Column-oriented databases differ from row oriented traditional databases where entire rows are stored contiguously.
In Column-oriented database data are grouped by columns and subsequent columns are stored contiguously on the disk.
Storing values on a per column basis increases the efficiency when all the values are not needed.

The Data is Hbase will be organized by the means of table only (as part of the x-axis,y-axis & z-axis).
Data will be stored in the form of (K,V) pair where       K-> Timestamp generated by Hbase,     V-> Data what we load-----

---Features of HBase-----------------------------------

> HBase is linearly scalable.
> It has automatic failure support.
> It provides consistent read and writes.
> It integrates with Hadoop, both as a source and a destination.
> It has easy java API for client.
> It provides data replication across clusters.


---Storage Mechanism in HBase--------------------------

> Base is a column-oriented database and the tables in it are sorted by row. The table schema defines only column families, which are the key value pairs. A table have multiple column families and each column family can have any number of columns. Subsequent column values are stored contiguously on the disk. Each cell value of the table has a timestamp. In short, in an HBase:
       Table is a collection of rows.
       Row is a collection of column families.
       Column family is a collection of columns.
       Column is a collection of key value pairs

---Where to Use HBase---------------------------------

> Apache HBase is used to have random, real-time read/write access to Big Data.
> It hosts very large tables on top of clusters of commodity hardware.
> Apache HBase is a non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable. 
Bigtable acts up on Google File System, likewise Apache HBase works on top of Hadoop and HDFS.

---Applications of HBase--------------------------------

> It is used whenever there is a need to write heavy applications.
> HBase is used whenever we need to provide fast random access to available data.
> Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Adobe use HBase internally.
