Sharding

The term sharding describes the logical separation of records into horizontal partitions.
The idea is to spread data across multiple storage files—or servers—as opposed to having each stored contiguously.

The separation of values into those partitions is performed on fixed boundaries: 
you have to set fixed rules ahead of time to route values to their appropriate store. 
With it comes the inherent difficulty of having to reshard the data when one of the horizontal partitions exceeds its capacity.
Resharding is a very costly operation, since the storage layout has to be rewritten.

This entails defining new boundaries and then horizontally splitting the rows across them. 
Massive copy operations can take a huge toll on I/O performance as well as temporarily elevated storage requirements. 
And you may still take on updates from the client applications and need to negotiate updates during the resharding process.
